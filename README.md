# ginza, my go code store

This repository is named after the famous and internationally renowed shopping
district located in Chuo, Tokyo. As far back as the 15th century Ginza has grown as a marketplace
for department stores, boutiques, and restraunts that was originally a banking district and an
example of the modernization of Japan during the Meiji Era. Similarily, Go is a modern language that
is a model for programming languages and computer science in the 21st century.
